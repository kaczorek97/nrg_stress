😵‍💫 **Dynamic Stress System for RP**

Add a whole new layer of immersion to your RP server with a fully customizable stress system! Players' actions trigger real psychological effects that influence their movement, aim, and overall gameplay, making stress management a vital part of roleplay.

🧠 **Stress Levels and Effects**  
Stress accumulates dynamically and is divided into **6 distinct stages**, each with escalating impact:

- 🟢 **No Stress** – Calm and steady, no penalties  
- 🟡 **Low Stress** – Minor distractions and slight hand tremors  
- 🟠 **Medium Stress** – Noticeable visual effects and impaired focus  
- 🔴 **High Stress** – Strong tremors and reduced aiming accuracy  
- ☠️ **Very High Stress** – Severe control issues, intense screen effects  
- 💀 **Extreme Stress** – Critical state, maximum difficulty in controlling actions  

Each stage is fully configurable, with adjustable timers and effect intensity to fit your server’s needs.

⚡ **Sources of Stress**  
Stress increases due to various in-game events:

- 🔫 **Shooting** – Every shot fired adds stress  
- 🚗 **Car Crashes** – Collisions cause a spike in stress  
- 🥊 **Fights** – Engaging or receiving hits adds to stress  
- 🏎️ **Fast Driving** – Speeding elevates stress over time  
- 💀 **Witnessing Death** – Seeing NPCs or players killed adds stress  

Each source can be toggled or fine-tuned individually.

Additionally, using exports you can add more sources such as:

- 💥 **Robberies and Break-ins** – stress from criminal actions  
- 🔥 **Explosions and Fires**  
- 🚨 **Police Interactions and Chases**  
- 🕵️ **Observing Dangerous Situations**

This allows full customization and expansion of your stress mechanics.

🧘‍♂️ **Stress Relief and RP Items**

The system does not include built-in items to reduce stress, but you can **create your own immersive RP items** (e.g., cigarettes, medicines, calming tea) that decrease stress by using the available **exports**.

This enables unique gameplay mechanics and richer immersion.

🛡️ **Stress Immunity and Temporary Buffs**

Through exports you can grant players:

- 🚫 Immunity to stress from specific activities (like shooting or car crashes)  
- ⏳ Temporary reduction of incoming stress by a percentage for a limited time  

This adds advanced roleplay elements and character progression.
